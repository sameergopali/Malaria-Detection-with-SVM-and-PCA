# Malaria Detection with SVM and PCA

This notebook focuses on the detection of malaria in cell using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. The nodebook uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning and the PIL library for image processing.

## Prerequisites

Before using the notebok, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [PIL (Python Imaging Library)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pillow
